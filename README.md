# Secrets Everywhere: Auditing Memorization in Mobility Prediction Models

This is code for the work Secrets Everywhere: Auditing Memorization in Mobility Prediction Models.
It evaluates deep trajectory next-location prediction models for memorization of training data.

## Project Structure

The project compares multiple model architectures. Each architecture's folder contains
the code to train and evaluate that model, with the corresponding usage instructions in `USAGE.md`.
